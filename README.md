# library-app

## LIVE PREVIEW HERE: https://trshpuppy.github.io./library/library.html
### This is my library app project for the Odin Project (theodinproject.com).
You can see the details of the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

The requirements for this project included creating a library app implementing JS, HTML, and CSS. The focus was on using JS to create and update a library array based on the users input of books, read and unread. Per the Oding Project, this app will be re-visited later in the curriculum in order to implement back-end data storage.

### JS lessons:
This project taught me a lot about creating and updating objects in an array based on the end-users input, as well as updating the UI based on changes in the array.
### HTML/CSS lessons:
For this app I focused heavily on having a repsonsive design. By starting my design at a mobile resolution, I was able to successfully scale upwards and am happy with the product. Please test it out!

Time spent: 29 hours.
